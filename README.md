# Keyboard Layout
This is just a custom keyboard layout to use on Windows.
## Main Objetives
* It should work on both ISO and ANSI keyboards. That means, it should not rely on the extra key present on ISO keyboards between the _left shift_ and the _Z_.
* It should retain all features of _Spanish - Latinoamerican_ keyboard layout.
* It should add alternative keys for "<" and ">", as those symbols are mapped the key that exists only on ISO keyboards.
* It should support Spanish unique symbols (ñ, á, é, í, ó, ú, ü) and german unique symbols (ß, ä, ë, ö).
* It should support dollar and euro symbols.

##Added characteres
