# Keyboard Layout 
This is a custom keyboard layout to use on Windows suited to my needs of using characters from different languages on different keyboards (ANSI/ISO) without breaking the basics of the layout I used my whole life.


## Main Objetives
* It should work on both ISO and ANSI keyboards. That means, it should not rely on the extra key present on ISO keyboards between the _left shift_ and the _Z_.
* It should retain all features of _Spanish - Latinoamerican_ keyboard layout.
* It should add alternative keys for "<" and ">", as those symbols are mapped the key that exists only on ISO keyboards.
* It should support Spanish unique symbols (ñ, á, é, í, ó, ú, ü, Ñ, Á, É, Í, Ó, Ú, Ü) and german unique symbols (ß, ä, ë, ö, ẞ, Ä, Ë, Ö).
* It should support dollar and euro symbols.
* Using "shift + _something_" should always produce the same result as doing "(caps on) _something_".
* Map "<" and ">" to ctrl + alt + Z/X, to imitate the behaviour of the latinoamerican spanish layout I use on Linux.


##Added characteres
### Currencies
* ₩: ctrl + shift + W
* €: ctrl + shift + E
* ¥: ctrl + shift + Y
* $: ctrl + shift + S
* £: ctrl + shift + L

Note: Dollar symbol was already possible to do. Just added it for consistency.


### Special characters for Spanish, German and other languages
* ß (lowercase eszett): ctrl + alt + S
* ẞ (uppercase eszett): shift + ctrl + alt + S
* ñ (lowercase eñe): ctrl + alt + N
* Ñ (uppercase eñe): shift + ctrl + alt + N
* ä: ctrl + alt + A
* Ä: shift + ctrl + alt + A
* ë: ctrl + alt + E
* Ë: shift + ctrl + alt + E
* ï: ctrl + alt + I
* Ï: shift + ctrl + alt + I
* ö: ctrl + alt + O
* Ö: shift + ctrl + alt + O
* ü: ctrl + alt + U
* ü: shift + ctrl + alt + U

Notes:
* Letters with diacritic are already possible on the default keyboard distribution used as a base. I just added a more comfortable way to type them.
* _ñ_ and _Ñ_ where added for consistency.


### Others
* @: ctrl + shift + Q
* <: ctrl + alt + Z
* \>: ctrl + alt + X
